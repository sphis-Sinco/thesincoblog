I think clean code is important but a waste of time at the same time.

If you are working in a team, clean code is helpful to try and keep order to the source code of the project.

If you are working alone, clean code is just a waste of time and is just something that keeps you from making the project.

If you seek clean code than I think you should work in a team so there is a reason to have clean code. Cause unless you are open-sourcing your code and are sensitive about how your code looks to others, stick to the mess.

Those are my thoughts, here is your quote:

“Who gives a damn if you are alone? You can work your best when you are alone”
