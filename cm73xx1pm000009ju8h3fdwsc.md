A little news post.

* Sinco has another new design (S-HR-3, gonna codename these cause why not?): the S is gone, and the shoes are simpler.
    
* A new comic has been made: Sinco adventure: Hyper (video coming soon and a little teaser as the cover made digitally)
    
* The digital sinco adventure webtoon comic is canceled.
    
* I will focus more on just comics made for fun, which is why the start of this change is Sinco adventure: Hyper, I had fun making it and that's going to be the leading drive for these comics
    
* Sinco and Portilizen's development has slowed but the game is still in my mind, once I finish the prototype stage a pre-alpha will be released to the public and the games history will form itself.
    
* I won't give exact dates but the Sinco and Portilizen pre-alpha should come out in Febuary or March
    
* The quotes for Blog posts will cease.
    
* The Portable\_sinco channel will get more focus with the random short videos taken after-school and the comic videos
    
* I will most likely have a site for comics, I will take pictures and put them on there. Or I will make Blog posts here that are pictures of the comic so you guys can read and enjoy them without my most likely obnoxious commentary and on-the-spot voiceover.
    
* Sinco designs now have codenamed to them cause why not?
