# Early thoughts (before reading):

## Cons

* This is a terrible decision for those who dislike A.I. features and for Microsoft themselves, since they aren't fans of the Artificial Intelligence they will naturally be pushed away from the platform, most likely moving to Linux or Mac \[ETFootnotes 1\]
    
* People do not like being bothered by A.I. so unless Mircosoft has it easily toggleable and not a constant bother people will still be more drawn to Linux or Mac \[ETFootnotes 1\]
    
* Having to deal with “AI Credits”. No one wants to have to wait for a replenish of a digital currency just to use the software, it's the same situation with advertisements, no one wants them, but they are forced on us. There is a reason that [the creator of ads publicly apologized for them](https://www.newsweek.com/ethan-zuckerman-popup-ads-creator-internet-warnings-2020538#:~:text=He%20graduated%20with%20an%20M.A.,free%20expression%20and%20innovation%20online.).
    

## Pros

* People who use AI frequently can have an AI partner built-in to their OS, resulting in less searches for ChatGPT \[ETFootnotes 2\]
    

## ETFootnotes

1. To my knowledge Linux and Mac aren't that focused on A.I. integration so compared to windows it seems like a better choice for those disliking A.I.
    
2. Or whatever AI they are using.
    

# Thoughts (after reading)

## Pros

* Recall does seem like a good feature, helps find tabs from awhile ago that you maybe forgot to bookmark.
    

## Cons

* $999. Who has the money for that…? Atleast do what Apple does and let people pay a small amount per month, jeez.
    
* Image editing with AI is a recipe for disaster cause AI can't get it right, just, not the right time period.
    
* $899 for a Dev Kit? Jeez, and I thought Apple was robbing people of their money.
    

# Final thoughts

6.5/10.

1. $999. Point deduction.
    
2. $899 for a dev kit. Point deduction.
    
3. Recall would be useful.
    
4. Image editing with AI. Point deduction.
    
5. The whole AI Scheme entirely would be a Point Deduction but it COULD, work. Half a point deduction.
    

Honestly just seems like a cash grab hopping on the trend of AI. With these prices I honestly want them to go from binary to base 10. Idk just seems like it'd somehow make more sense.
