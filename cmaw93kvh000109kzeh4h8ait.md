*Woah a blog post not made by AI, noice.*

What I ran a jam every like month or so where people make art and the one I like the most wins?

Now to be fair not that many people would even participate in the jam, the discord server doesn't even have more then 20 people (including alternate accounts). But it's whatever, it's just a thought.
