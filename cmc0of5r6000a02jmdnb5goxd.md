# Grab is out

The game “Grab” is now available on itch.io, 16 puzzle levels and a cutscene at the end. Wanna try speedrunning it?

# Missing executable builds?

Grab is missing executable builds because I am discussing a payment plan for the executable builds and thus extra content, think of it like this: The web build is the demo, you get to check out the game before you spend money on it, and if you do spend money on it you are rewarded with more game content, don’t worry though, the prices won’t be ridiculous.

## Payment Plan

The plan is for the game to be $5 but you can pay less with the minimum price being $2.50. I don’t want to steal your money. I want you to pay on your own terms, but at the same time I still want to get something from it. So, the recommended price is $5. But you can pay a minimum of $2.50. But you don’t even have to pay. I will provide you a free web version that allows you to play the Minimum Viable Product I have accepted for the game.

You can still give me a review a game, if you buyed it or not. But if you do give a review, just know that I will not be adding a bunch of content to the web build. The web build is just a proof of concept for you to try and convince you to buy the game. Not the entire game. Infact I am planning an update of the game that will provide more levels, more mechanics, and overall it will just be a better game entirely. I’m planning it, and by the time the decision is made on the payment plan fully, it will begin production. Until then it will just be minor hotfixes. Maybe atleast 1 or 2 new mechanics for the web build.

# Reviews

So far Grab only has 1 review from TJ, a newbie at Salida. Paul leps is also a newbie and will be providing a review, as for Yakasha I am unaware if I can get him to provide a review. But I am aiming for 2 reviews minimum on the game page.
