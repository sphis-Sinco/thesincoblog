TLDR; Paul leps is main creator on "Sinco Adventure"

# Announcement

Paul leps is now the main lead for "Sinco Adventure" and the mini comics/sagas related to it.

As "Sinco Retold" continues I don't want to leave fans of "Sinco Adventure" to just be waiting for atleast something.

So, both comics will be going simultaneously, me, Paul, and anyone else working on it will work together on "Sinco Adventure" while I work on "Sinco Retold" with most likely the same people except its mostly just me doing my own thing.

# Potential Questions

## When will Sinco Adventure end?

"Sinco Adventure" was supposed to end with the Orin saga, Sinco being sent back in time to redo it all, which would start "Sinco Retold", but plans change and "Sinco Retold" was put into production.

## Will you still be making Sinco Adventure comic dub videos?

Oh believe me you couldn't get me to stop the comic dubs no matter how hard you try. I'll probably do a mix of "Sinco Adventure" and "Sinco Retold" comic dubs including the mini-comics but other than that they aren't stopping anytime soon. I'd say about April they will start up again, but that's just a rough estimate, you guys know how I am with deadlines.

## Will Sinco Adventure end?

Nothing cannot be forever. Sinco Adventure will have to end. It probably would've with the Orin saga, or with Chapter 3. Depending on how I felt. The production on Sinco Adventure wasn't my cup of tea and I was putting more effort into it than I bargained for. I was facing diminishing returns, it wouldn't last. It didn't last. And that's why I've made this decision.

## Why did you pick Paul Leps of all people?

I trust him with it and he has shown the most dedication to basically most of the things I've made, and I believe he will bring Sinco Adventure an ending I never would've brought.

Buenas noches amigos.

Catch you in the morning.
