Like a minute ago I thought of making another game launcher for specifically small games I’ve made.

Right now I am watching by Juniper Dev titled “Make Tiny Games.” And I now have the motivation to make tiny games. Like little game jams. Actually. That’s probably what I am going to do maybe.

Now, more fresh thoughts, instead of a launcher I could just make… tiny games.

It could defenitely help me improve in godot more, or maybe a new game engine I decide to learn, or just a programming language. GameMaker. GDevelop. Love 2D. C#, C++, C, Python, JavaScript. You get it.

I doupt I’m going to get any feedback in regards to this idea so I’m just gonna…do it.

Adios mis pensamientos.
