Haxeflixel is an underrated language outside of Friday Night Funkin (at least I think so) and I think you should use it!

I’ve been using it since maybe late 2022 early 2023? And it’s been a pretty cool language.

It is very easy to learn if you are similar with Java, C++, PHP, AS3, or any similar object-oriented language.

I wasn’t familiar with any of those except maybe some C++ snippets cause I was trying to learn it…

**Trying**.

But yeah it was easy to learn especially when I was just modifying the code of Funkin’.

It was trial and error and now it’s resulted in me working on Sinco and Portilizen whenever and however possible.

Haxeflixel hello world snippet:

```haxe
package;

import flixel.FlxState;

class PlayState extends FlxState
{
    override public function create()
    {
        super.create();
        trace("Hello world");
    }
}
```

Anyway time for an article quote:
