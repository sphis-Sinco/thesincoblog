# Where Have the Blogs Been?

Hey everyone—long time, no post.

I could list all kinds of reasons: being busy, working on other projects, tech limitations... but let’s be real. I just completely forgot about blogging. That’s it. No sugar-coating. I’ve been caught up in other things, and the blog just dropped off my radar.

That said, I haven’t been idle. I’ve been working on some cool projects and cooking up ideas that I’d love to share. So here’s a quick update on what’s been going on, what I’m working on, and some things I’m thinking about for the future.

# What I’ve Been Up To

## Sinco Retold (Comic Series)

This is the big one. Sinco Retold is a comic series I’ve been steadily building—writing, sketching, rewriting, refining. It’s taken up most of my time, and honestly, it’s been worth it. It’s slow but fulfilling work, and it’s the main reason you haven’t seen many posts from me lately.

## YouTube

Still doing YouTube in between comic work. Content has been inconsistent, but I’ve been playing around with ideas, editing styles, and different formats. It’s another creative outlet I enjoy—when I can find the time.

## Phone-Only Workflow

Right now, I’m mostly limited to using my phone for everything, including blog writing. It’s not ideal. It makes long-form writing harder, which definitely contributed to the blog silence. Not an excuse (well, maybe a little), but that’s been the reality.

# Ideas I’m Thinking About

Even if I’m not releasing much right now, the ideas haven’t stopped flowing. Here are a few I’ve been thinking about that might turn into real projects:

## Version Control System in Scratch/Turbowarp

I’ve been brainstorming a super basic version control system built entirely inside Scratch or Turbowarp. Think Git, but visual. It’d track changes, maybe simulate commits with lists and variables, and be a great way to teach the basics of versioning through Scratch logic.

## Android Games Made in Scratch

I’m planning to create full Android games directly using Scratch (via Turbowarp). Not converting Scratch games to APKs just for fun—but intentionally designing mobile-first experiences using Scratch’s logic and exporting them for Android play. Scratch as a real mobile dev tool? Let’s see.

## Serial Code Generator in Scratch

Just a small idea: building a working serial/key generator using Scratch. It could have some neat uses in projects like game unlocks, puzzles, or even reward systems. Simple, but fun to build and show off.

# TL;DR

* I forgot to blog.
    
* Focused on Sinco Retold and YouTube.
    
* Phone-only access has made writing harder.
    
* Brainstorming new Scratch/Turbowarp projects like version control systems, serial generators, and Android-first games.
    
* Not aiming to “return” to blogging—just planning to post a bit more often when it makes sense.
    

This post was written with help from AI (ChatGPT), based on my direction and ideas. It’s still my thoughts—just organized with a little assist.

Thanks for reading.
