Since it's inception of l of my youtube channels, there has never been a proper upload scedule for any one of them.

But finally l have decided upon some form of an upload scedule for the “Portable\_Sinco” channel.

Every Monday and Friday will be a major video.

As for the unimportant videos they will most likely just get posted on mondays and fridays unless there are important enough to defy the scedule.

That is all.

Adios gente.
