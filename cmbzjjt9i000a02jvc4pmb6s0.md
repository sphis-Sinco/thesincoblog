# Salida Aleatoria

Salida Aleatoria, spanish for “Random output”, is the latest indie game studio by Sinco, not legally founded, but it is what we will call ourself regardless.

# Product info

The game is simple, you manuever around a maze looking for a key outside of your visability, and then locating the door assosiated with the key.

# Product development

The game production has gone about how you would expect for a simple game, initally I was just going to have it be short but then I realized I could defenitely do more, when I made Mechanical Support, I planned for another game taking place in the same world, when I made EDFT and EDFO I knew those would be in the same universe as my comic “Sinco Retold”. So I figured I could have Salida games taking place in the same game. It took a bit before settling on the final game idea, mainly due to scope and motivation issues. But finally there is a product that stays IN production.

# Product release range

June 17th 2025 and June 18th 2025. That is the date range of release, having an extra day just in-case. I would like to add some additional content besides the main gameplay once the levels are done, so I am adding the extra day just incase it takes longer then anticipated.

So, mark your calander for june 17th to june 18th. On [the official Salida Aleatoria itch.io page](https://salida-aleatoria.itch.io) “Grab” will release.

# Salida Aleatoria is hiring!

So far the Salida Aleatoria team is only 2 people, Sinco and Yakasha. Both knowing each other in real life and thus allowing the ability to work closely and quickly despite Yakasha working. But more developers would defenitely help make more quality over quantity products.
