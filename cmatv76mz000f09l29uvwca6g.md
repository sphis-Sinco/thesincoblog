Hey everyone!

I’m excited to share that [Issue 70 of Sinco Retold](https://discord.com/channels/1274153997368037518/1373158308034383893/1373691331481702562) is now live!

This issue was especially fun to put together because it features one of my favorite fight scenes in the series so far. For the choreography, I took heavy inspiration from classic Dragon Ball manga panels. In particular, I referenced this chapter on [MangaDex](https://mangadex.org/chapter/5e6fdd5b-3fb1-4f09-b757-792da25d7e37/3) to guide the pacing, posing, and momentum of the action. Toriyama’s dynamic panel work has always been a huge influence, and recreating that energy in my own style was both a challenge and a joy.

Drawing the fight scene and experimenting with different poses was a lot of fun—it really reminded me why I love making comics. That said, not everything went smoothly. My pencil decided to snap mid-sharpening (classic), which threw off my groove for a bit. But hey, I managed. The page survived. The story lives on.

If you’ve been following along, thank you. Your support means everything, and I hope you enjoy the explosive energy in this chapter. If you're new, now’s a great time to jump in and see what Sinco Retold is all about.

Catch you in the next update!
