# The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is created by **Francesco Cirillo** for a more productive way to work and study. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

# Sinco 1: the timer

So, one day I decided to set a timer for 30 minutes to get work done on SAP v0.3a.

I started the timer, started working, and before you knew it… the update was finished. I finished level 2 and all that was left were QOL and polishing. Then this wave of motivation hit and I’ve been working on SAP since with this high rush almost every time I worked on it, it just because an everyday thing which I LOVE.

2 patch updates later and now I’ve decided to plan ahead.

As of now, updates v0.4a til v1.1 (notice the missing a) are planned.

So far it’s basically a TODO list, instead of making it up when we are working on it, we can work on features from like v0.11a just to get that update closer to release once true development starts.

Right here with the censored tasks for 0.4a you can see that most of the items are orange, which means they have started production.

And here for 0.5a (you just have to trust me :)) you can also see that some have started production, and one is even finished.

This is because of this new system of working ahead. It’s based off of how FNF is doing all of their shit, if someone is still working on their shit while every one else is done, they can work on future shit like roadmaps, new art and animations, character designs, etc etc.

I’ve been doing my hardest to try and get Paul leps and Djotta Flow to get some work done on their part so the game isn’t 95% dependent on me.

Anyway I am going to pass it to Paul, and then DJ.

# Paul leps (with some modifications)

What's poppin' little bitches. It is i. The depressed enraged burnt out and mentally broken in every way fucker that is Paul

Here to say that's it's somewhat fun to work on this. Even though I don't do much. I still like this and you better too. Cause port (Sinco) put hard work into this you hating asshole troll who I KNOW came here to mock him. I SEE YOU AND I HAVE YOU FUCKING IP &gt;:(. Sorry about that folks i know that pieces of shit was reading this. Anyways i would just like to say thank you for sticking out and being someone that actually cares. I hope we can make the best game we can. And that the internet regrets it's accursed actions. Btw if i see one bit of sinco rule 34 I'm gonna start committing murders. That's not a joke i will end people

# Djotta flow (with some modifications)

Hey I'm actually from a different country, and I work on Portuguese translations for the game! Sometimes I get lazy and don't get that much work done.

Btw Sinco and I met because of a scratch project, just felt like you should know that.

# Sinco 2: Roadmap

Not even a week ago, I revealed the April roadmap for the game, and I’m not delaying anything like moving Destination 3 to May, but I am revealing the May portion of the roadmap. At least as of right now, I would like another update to make it in but I have to make sure we can even manage to get these 2 in.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1744416165152/5cfd31d5-00d3-46c7-bf72-4f10a4fa54c9.png align="left")

Sorry for not being in a cool style like the previous roadmap, but I’m just trying to quickly get some news out to you guys and then getting back to actual work.

But yeah I’m finally revealing that the pitstop 2 is a new level type: a “**Sidebit”**, think of it like levels that take place in-between other levels, a mini-level, a pitstop for the road. In this case, Sidebit 1 is gonna take place after Level 2, and RIGHT after Level 4, do keep in mind the first 3 levels are sinco levels and portilizen levels are the second half of the 6. Both happening ***around*** the same time. But since Sinco is a speedster, he got to his level first, so Portilizen has to play catch-up when he gets to his first level after sinco is finished with his.

But yes indeed, there will also be a new level, then another Sidebit, then a Playable STCS, if you do not know who STCS is I do not blame you.

He is the “antagonist” of my series from 2022 or 2023 “[Portilizens Revenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUlj46e4WOc)”. And *WAS* the father figure of Portilizen, but then changed to be an Older brother.

But he will become a playable character in the 0.7a update for Sinco and Portilizen. I will not give any further details until the update begins full development.

That is the blog post for today. Have a good day, afternoon, evening, or night.
