```bash
Hello World
```

That is probably the most printed message in consoles.

And you know why?

It’s because of the obvious thing…everyone else does it LMAO!

But it’s also simple enough to get used to a language syntax. And yeah. It works!

Please tell me if you would continue coding in Java (no hate for the language! It’s just an example I swear lol!) if you had to type all of this:

```java
public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

When you can do something like this in Python:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

The difference is VERY noticeable!

Anyway, that’s it for my first article on “The sinco blog”!

I will leave you with this:

“Who cares if it’s good or not? “
