I have this incredibly talented artist friend who recently agreed to create a drawing of my character using a reference I made.

After about 2 or 3 days of anticipation, she finally completed the artwork yesterday, and I can't express how ecstatic I am with the result—it's absolutely stunning!

I'm so happy with this drawing that I’ve updated all (I’m pretty sure) of my social media profiles to feature this piece as my profile picture.

I genuinely hope you all appreciate it as much as I do, because it has also inspired some changes to Sinco's design. Notably, his front hair is now longer, while his back spikes are styled similarly to Sonic's quills from the series “Sonic X.” Additionally, he's sporting a pair of stylish gloves and an eye-catching new necklace, which actually plays a key role in his lore.

Instead of just having lightning shoot out from him when he gets angry or runs, this energy is now contained within the necklace, giving it additional significance in the story. Also less drawing I would have to do lol.

I absolutely adore this drawing! It's also a fun detail that my friend used the colors inspired by Sinco and Portilizen's title screen character ring, which made me chuckle when I saw it.

A huge thank you to H.R. for capturing my vision so beautifully! &lt;3

To sum it all up, I'm just eager to share this excitement with you all.

Now onto the article quote:
