Hello there my amigos. Today I am here to talk about a new FNF engine I’ve made cause I love torturing myself with coding LOL. Let’s not do some overdramatic fanfare and just get onto it.

[Sinco engine](https://github.com/sphis-Sinco/The-Sinco-Engine) is the new FNF engine I am working on which is just planned to be QOL FNF V-slice additions. Who even knows how long I’ll be working on this LMAO. But yeah, I’ve just decided to start working on another FNF engine in my free time when I’m bored and yeah.

You can check out the github [here](https://github.com/sphis-Sinco/The-Sinco-Engine) and that’s about it. I’ll probably make a video or 2 on it soon, compiling has been a pain, like seriously, a PAIN in the ass, it’s unbelievable. Right now while I’m typing this shit it’s doing compiling shit. Oh wait.

Never mind. But yeah, I’m torturing myself again.

OH GOD
