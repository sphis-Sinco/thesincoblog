Heh, hey guys.

Been almost a month since the last SAP Devlog. The game’s released! An extra prototype version and then v0.1.0 alpha!

Sadly no new level, but that’s coming, we’ll get to that.

v0.0.8-p is just a Settings menu update

v0.1.0a is bug fixes and getting the game working for HTML5

v0.1.1a is more bug fixes

v0.2.0a next month (this month!!!!!!) with HScript modding n shit!!!!!!

v0.2.1a removes it cause of MANY issues :(

and yeah, that’s just about it, but now

we are back working on the game, we got a rest of Q1 2025 roadmap, and we are working on LEVEL 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So yeah

game is back in production and we are working on level 2!

Hope your excited, the rest of Q1 2025 is going to be nice.
