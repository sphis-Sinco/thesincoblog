A lot has happened since the “Channel 3rd Anniversary” video regarding Sinco and Portilizen.

Check out this changelog since the version in the video:

```markdown
# Prototype
## 0.0.4-p - 2/1?/2025
### Changed
- Changed system for levels beat
- Changed savedata `level` to `levels_completed`
- Changed Screenshot plugin to now be the FNF Screenshot Plugin (same keybind, its just based of funkin to fix a bug)
### Added
- Added countdown text to Stage 4
- HMM file
- Results State
- Several Compiler Condition Flags
- Discord RPC
### Removed
- Removed unused data files
- Removed Chaos Emeralds (Gameplay and code)
### Fixed
- Fixed bug where DISABLE_PLUGINS enables plugin _(ignore the extra _, hashnode is a bit weird with Markdown_)
- Fixed bug where the screenshot [didnt do things](/random-bugs/screenshotplugin-before.png) it [should've been doing](/random-bugs/screenshotplugin-after.png)

## 0.0.3-p - 2/13/2025
- Gameplay changes
        - Added screenshot plugin (you can take a screenshot with F2 unless in debug, you do F1)
        - Added stage 4 winning condition (you have to survive the level for a minute)
        - We are now in the prototype era officially
- Code changes:
        - Modified `Global.setEmeraldAmount()` function
        - Moved every folder that is sap specific to the new sap folder
        - Moved Debug build and Game version traces to the project xml
        - Added echo for build/test targets
        - Added ability to enable and disable annoying errors and warnings
        - Added compiler error for mobile
                - Compiling for mobile doesnt work
        - `FileManager_v8` now has been replaced with `Sinlib`'s `FileManager` (basically the same though)
        - Now using 8 tabs instead of like 2 or 4 spaces or smth?
        - In the code I have this little code style I've started implementing:
                - Don't leave unused imports in the code
                - Code shouldnt be more than 4 tabs long unless optimizing wouldn't do much.
```

And this is only going by the time I’m writing this. There is going to be more.

Do you see that Discord RPC addition?

You can see that on my Discord profile too.

So yeah, just a quick progress update.

Development gets faster as motivation increases.

So yeah, just came to tell you bout that.
